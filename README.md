This project contains a minimal example showing the basic usage of sync-client to synchronize state across multiple web application clients.  It's a bare-bones app created using `create-react-app` which renders a message and a colored box on the screen, and any connected client can edit the text or move the box around.  Even though it was written for the origial version of sync-client around two years ago and hasn't been maintained since, the basic principles should still be the same.
